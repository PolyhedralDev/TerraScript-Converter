# TerraScript Converter

**As of version 6.0, use Sponge format for static structures!**

This repository contains a simple application to convert `tstructure` files to the newer TerraScript structure format.

To use, simply download the latest release, place it in a folder with your `tstructure` files, then run it (either via
the command line or by double-clicking). All `.tstructure` files in the directory of the application will be converted
to TerraScript (`.tesf`) files with the same blocks, center, and spawn criteria.
The `.tstructure` files will be preserved.
